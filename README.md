# Blog_FrontEnd
Blog App FRONT end built with Ember 2.x

A blog app that allows the user to create and comment on blog posts. All posts and comments can also be deleted.

The front end is built with *Ember 2.3*, while *Rails 5* was used to build the backend to serve and persist the data.  NOTE: This app uses the rails API that is available in the Blog_BackEnd repo.

### To install the FRONT End app:
1. Clone this repo.  

2. cd into "Blog_FrontEnd" directory and run "npm install" followed by "bower install".
Run "ember s" to start the ember app,

### TO INSTALL THE BACKEND API:
3. Clone my other repo titled "Blog_BackEnd".  The instructions to install are in that repo's readme.  

Enjoy.

### NOTE:
The original purpose of this app was to quickly build a simple Ember 2.x frontend that could communicate with Rails 5 on the backend. This app started from the tutorial: http://9elements.com/io/index.php/an-ember-js-application-with-a-rails-api-backend/.  FYI, I made quite a few changes from the original tutorial (JSONAPIAdapter, serializing, deserializing, etc).

### Note: Styling, advance functionality, etc will be added at a later date. ###
